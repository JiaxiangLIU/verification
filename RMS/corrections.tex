%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress,noadjust]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage[noadjust]{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

\usepackage{algpseudocode}


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
\usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

\section{Answers to the Reviewers}
\subsection{Reviewer 1}
Comments to the Author

The paper shows a realistic implementation of a Rate-Monotonic
Scheduling algorithm using Real-Time Maude (a modeling language based
on rewriting logic) by taking into account the overhead of scheduling
and some other details of the hardware platform. The correctness of
the implementation with respect to the algorithm and the completeness
of the model are verified by model checking, and validated within
different realistic scenarios.

On the positive side, this paper presents a solid piece of
work. Periodic task scheduling is an important (and difficult)
problem, and the topic of the paper appears to be well suited within
the field of the industrial real-time systems. Overall the paper is
well structured, technically accurate, presents the work in a
comprehensive and reasonable way, and tackles theoretical as well as
practical aspects. There are two principal contributions of the paper:

1) A novel implementation of the Rate-Monotonic Scheduling algorithm,
which contains more complex and realistic details instead of the ideal
setting.

2) Rate-Monotonic Scheduling is investigated using Real-Time Maude for
the first time, to apply formal methods such as model checking and
theorem proving to analyze theoretical results, verify desired
properties, and evaluate results.

On the negative side:

1) The weak point is the lack of evidence of practicality, efficiency
and scalability. Since there are only small and simplistic scenarios
to analyze this model, it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of
the proposed implementation. The key scenarios appear conveniently
small to allow the implementation fully supports all these examples,
returning at the same time appropriate counterexamples to guide and
adjust the design. Is this true for larger examples of "real world"
applications within the field of industrial real-time systems? How do
the authors propose to handle very large scenarios? How does it behave
on typical real-time scheduling problems used in industry? I would
like to see more complex examples to convince the reader of the
practicability of the approach on the assumptions given for the model,
and would probably increase the mentioned benefits. The paper does not
give any directions to the above problems, and some sentences pointing
out the difficulties in the implementation of more generic and
realistic scenarios would be most welcome to understand the real
contribution of the paper.

\ANSWER: As mentioned in the paper, the modeled RMS implementation
serves in an avionic control systems from our industrial partner. It
is a real-world application within the field of industrial real-time
systems. And the scenarios presented in Section V.B are also real
scenarios that our partner is using in the system. Our partner
indicated that there would be at most $5$ tasks in the task set for
the implementation. On the other hand, in the current version, we have
randomly generated large numbers of test cases to examine the
efficiency of our schedulability test that is based on model checking,
as discussed in Section V.B. The capability of model checking is
restricted by the scale of the state space of the model. In our model,
the model checking can handle scenarios where $mn$ is up to $10^6$ in
an acceptable period of time. With $mn=10^6$ and reasonable task
periods, the number $n$ of tasks can be at least $10$, which has
already fulfilled the requirements of the target
implementation. Further with particular task periods, the number $n$
of tasks can be $20$ or more.


2) One of my biggest problems with the theoretical part of this work
is that the paper is technically solid as far as I can tell, but
there's not much yet in the way of theorems and results about formal
properties in Maude. The complete and detailed proof of the Theorem 2
should be provided somewhere. If the proof of the main results of
schedulability and correctness of the model is straightforward (as is
suggested) it seems not necessary to present a complex formalism on
Real-Time Maude and all the theorems provided are natural consequences
of Theorem 1. I agree that even non-surprising results need to be
investigated in the proof of Theorem 2, some sentences pointing out
the difficulties in the theoretical formalization in Real-Time Maude
would be most welcome. Please, include (e.g., in an appendix or even
in a technical report) a detailed proof.

\ANSWER: The detailed proof is now included in the Appendix. It is true
that readers may be interested in the detailed proof of Theorem~2 to
feel convinced of the completeness of our approach. However, the proof
needs a bit more theoretical background about rewriting logic and more
details of our model, which we have simplified in the submission to
ease the understanding of our approach. We would prefer to refer the
detailed proof to a non-anonymous technical report, if possible, in
the final version.

3) Another important point which needs improvement is the description
of the implementation. I guess other readers might have less
difficulties with the motivations if they know Maude and the Real-Time
Maude extension, but if you aim for a more general audience, it might
not work. Many pages are spent for the description of the formal
modeling of the implementation and the section is hard to read. I
highly recommend the authors to thoroughly revise this part of the
paper to make it easy-to-read. It would be better preferable to have a
much shorter description of the principal insights for the
implementation followed by more convincing examples and benchmarks
with respect to related work to convince the reader of the
practicability of the approach. You should try to summarize this
section and to extend the original contribution. From my point of
view, there is a trade off in this paper between the contributions and
the presentation of the implementation.

\ANSWER: Thank you for the invaluable suggestions. Section IV has been
revised. Some unnecessary detailed definitions presented as codes are
removed, and replaced by more explanations. We hope that the current
presentation would make Section IV more easy-to-read, even for an
audience who does not know Real-Time Maude before. On the other hand,
Section VI (Related Work) is also improved. We compare our work with
the existing theoretical work and the existing verification work in a
more complete way.

In conclusion, the RMS implementation proposed by the authors by using
Real-Time Maude is interesting, but not complete (theorems and results
about the formal modeling and verification of the implementation in
Maude ought be clearly demonstrated). Moreover, the weak point is the
lack of evidence for practicality, and the presentation of Section IV
can be improved. It's not clear at all how this kind of key scenarios
could actually run in practice in more general real-time
systems. However, I think that the paper is worthy of publication,
because is the first time that Rate-Monotonic Scheduling is
investigated using Real-Time Maude in a (more) realistic
implementation, providing a solid semantic foundation for formal
verification. Therefore, I recommend the (weak) acceptance of this
paper.

Some minor remarks:

- Page 7, Related Work. More comparisons with other approaches based
on model checking would help to evaluate pros and cons of an
implementation with Real-Time Maude with respect to different
languages and tools. The authors should review the comparison with
[24] and [25] more thoroughly. You should benchmark your approach
against others.

\ANSWER: The related work section is now improved. More comparisons
with the theoretical approaches and with [24,25] are added. The
differences with [24,25] in the models and in the way of modeling are
mainly discussed. On the other hand, it is a bit difficult to compare
the efficiency and scalability between [24,25] and our approach. One
reason is that we have a different setting with [24] and [25], because
the objectives are different: we aim at verifying an RMS implemention
from a real-world real-time system, while [24] and [25] targeted the
RMS algorithm itself. Another reason is that [24] and [25] presented
no discussion on the efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, they use
\verb|TMSVL| and an extension of SPIN, respectively, as verification
tools, which are not open-source, making it unable to re-implement
their work.

- Page 8, Conclusions. Where in the paper do you show that the details
of your "realistic" implementation are "sufficient" for the behaviors
of all real systems used in the current industry? This should be
briefly discussed.

\ANSWER: The statement has been corrected. The work presented in this
submission aims at modeling and verifying a realistic RMS
implementation in an industrial avonic system. It is a piece of real
work in the industry. Even though we believe that our approach could
be applied to other systems as well, it means more to that specific
one. In this sense, ``sufficient'' means that the details described in
our model meet the requirements and expectations from the users and
the engineers.


\subsection{Reviewer 2}
Comments to the Author

The paper proposes a new way of modelling Rate Monotonic Scheduling
(RMS).  The new modelling approach is more accurate than the
simplified way originally proposed by Liu and Layland, as it also
models some of the overhead that is present in a real system
(e.g. scheduling and switching time).  This implies taking some of the
hardware details into account.  The model, which is based on the
formal language of Real-Time Maude, can be analyzed using the formal
verification tools provided by Real-Time Maude.  The paper shows how
this approach can be used for modelling and analyzing a particular RMS
implementation.

Up to my knowledge, this is original work. Related papers address
different aspects and do not take implementation overhead into
account.

The technique proposed by the paper is of industrial interest because
it improves the accuracy of analyzing schedulability in RMS
implementations with respect to the bare application of the theoretic
schedulability result.

The paper is well written and it looks sound, but I could not check it
completely.

One of the problems with this paper is that it is not completely
self-contained.  Some knowledge about Real-Time Maude is necessary in
order to fully understand it.  I found the short introduction about
Real-Time Maude (section II.B) not enough for understanding the
formalism used in the rest of the paper (see details below).

\ANSWER: The Sections II.B and IV are improved to be more
self-contained now. The idea is that, Section II.B contains mainly an
overview of Real-Time Maude, and then Section IV describes the model
with introducing necessary syntax on-the-fly.

Another concern is that the significance of the paper could be much
better if the paper addressed the problem of modelling RMS in a more
general way. Instead, the paper takes the form of a case study, where
the formal modelling of one specific RMS implementation is presented,
rather than a general method for modelling and analyzing RMS
implementations.  

\ANSWER: Yes, we agree that we have two choices to do the work
presented in the paper: one is to develop a general way to model RMS
algorithms or implementations, and then instantiate the general model
to get a concrete one for our target system; the other is to shape an
accurate model of the target system directly. To us, there is a trade
off between these two directions. We chose the latter with some
concerns. By our experience, the engineers, who write the codes, and
those, who are in charge of verifying the system or the codes, are
usually not the same persons. When a verification engineer models a
system, he is actually abstacting the system or the codes. It is
difficult to ensure that the model behaves the same as the system or
the codes.  And it is more difficult to let other engineers and users
believe that the model behaves the same as the system or the
codes. Furthermore, the developers and users hope that the model
behaves not only the same as what they had in mind, but also the same
as what is written in the codes. A way out is to make the model not
only behave like the codes, but also ``look'' like the codes. This
requires the model to be as accurate as possible. It makes the model
specific, but improves the engineers' confidence in the model and the
verification results. That is also why we emphasize the
correspondences between the functions in the model and the lines in
the pseudocode, when we introduce our model in Section~IV. On the
other hand, we are also interested in the first choice. This will be
the future work and we would try to get a better balance between them.

Also, the discussion about soundness and
completeness of the analysis (section V.C) is not fully developed and,
once again, it refers to the specific model rather than being a
general result.

\ANSWER: The section about soundness and completeness is now made more
self-contained. The detailed proof of Theorem~2 is included in the
appendix. On the other hand, since we chose the accurate way to
achieve the model as discussed above, yes, the proof is a specific
one.

As a conclusion, even if the significance of the paper is not as much
as it could be, I think the paper provides something novel and
interesting for the readers. Hence, my recommendation is to accept
this paper provided it is made more self-contained (without assuming
any reader's knowledge about Maude) and the proof of completeness and
soundness is fully developed.

Detailed comments
\begin{itemize}
\item
Section II.B  

- In the definition of $IR$, it is not clear what $s$ and $s'$ are. I
guess they are states, but the concept of state was not introduced.

\ANSWER: Yes, they can be states. But more generally, they are
terms. This part has been modified to specify $s$ and $s'$ ($t$ and
$t'$ now) clearly.

- In the definition of a class, the authors should specify that a
class includes a collection of rules, otherwise this fact may be
missed.

\ANSWER: Thanks very much for reminding. This is added now.

\item
Section III 

- Page 2 right column, line -24: The implementation is shown as
schedule() in Figure 1 $\rightarrow$ The pseudocode of schedule() is
shown in Figure 1

\ANSWER: It is done.

\item
Section IV.A 

- I don't understand the meaning of [ctor] in the definition of some
operations (maybe because I have no specific background on Maude). I
could not find the explanation of this writing in the introduction to
Maude.

\ANSWER: Sorry for missing the explanation of \verb|[ctor]|. It is now
added when \verb|[ctor]| is used for the first time.

- For the stack sort, the authors mention operations push, pop and
peek, but then you don't write the definitions of these
operations. Instead, they write the definitions of bottom and \#,
which are not explained in the text. This part should be made clearer.

\ANSWER: Sorry for the misleading in the text. In fact, \verb|bottom|
and \verb|#| are constructors of sort \verb|Stack|. This part is
modified now. Some detailed definitions in codes are removed, and are
replaced by more explanations. We hope that the current presentation
would make Section IV more easy-to-read.

- Also, the meaning of NzNat is not explained.

\ANSWER: Sorry for this incompleteness. \verb|NzNat| did mean non-zero
natural numbers. \verb|NzNat| is now replaced by \verb|Nat| to reduce
unnecessary complexity for the readers.

\item
Section V.C

- In the statement of theorem 1, the definition of time-robust
real-time rewrite theory is missing. Also, the meaning of
tick-stabilizing atomic propositions is not defined. This makes the
section not self-contained.

\ANSWER: In fact, the definitions of time-robustness and
tick-stabilization (which is now replaced with tick-invariance)
require more knowledge about rewriting logic. We avoid introducing the
accurate definitions of them. Instead, we now give short descriptions
of them. More detailed introduction can be found in the Appendix.

- The proof of theorem 2 is missing. The authors just indicate how the
proof could be developed, but they do not develop it. A possibility
would be to point to a document where this proof has been developed.

\ANSWER: The detailed proof is now included in the appendix.  The
detailed proof requires a bit more theoretical background about
rewriting logic and more details of our model, which we tried to
simplify in the submission to ease the understanding of our
approach. We would prefer to refer the detailed proof to a
non-anonymous technical report, if possible, in the final version.

\subsection{Reviewer 3}
Comments to the Author

This paper stuides the implementation of a rate-monotonic scheduling
with real-time maude, according to my carefully reading of this paper,
I do not think this paper is qualified for TIE due to the following
reasons:

1. Rate-monotonic scheduling is a very simple scheduling and has been
sufficiently investigated in the field of embedded system, the authors
claim the innovation of this paper as the implementation using
real-time maude, however, I cannot see any special point (or
advantage) when using this real-time maude in modelling RMS.

\ANSWER: We agree that RMS is a very simple scheduling and is the
optimum at the same time among the fixed-prority ones, making it
widely applied and sufficiently investigated. Besides the ideal
setting, the schedulability of RMS was also investigated under
different kinds of implementations with consideration about overhead,
as we discuss in the related work section (Section VI). Despite the
reason that the existing results do not fit our target system using
RMS, the most important motivation to develop the work presented is
that, we aim at verifying the system not only for the schedulability,
but also for the correctness. That is, we want to verify that the
target system does schedule the tasks under the RMS algorithm. The
work presented should be seen as a verification problem, instead of a
schedulability test.

2. RMS has many different realization methods, no comparison is given
to justify the strong point of real-time maude when applied to RMS.

\ANSWER: The comparison is given in the related work section (Section
VI). We would say that we are not implementing RMS algorithm in
Real-Time Maude. In fact, we are using Real-Time Maude to model an
realistic implementation of RMS from an industrial avionic
system. There is no theoretical reason telling us that we have to use
Real-Time Maude to model the RMS implementation. However, the existing
verification work as far as we know cannot fit our needs, as discussed
in Section VI. Therefore, we developed the work in the paper, as a
piece of real work in the industry.

3. The assumptions given in IV is too rigid, which makes the
scheduling problem to be investigated by very simple, then what is the
difficulty?

\ANSWER: As an industrial application, we are not trying to make the
problem as difficult as possible. Instead, we are trying to simplify
the model so that the existing tools are able to solve, while the
target system satisfies the assumptions on the model so that the
verification results are trustworthy. On the other hand, the
assumptions are not so rigid. For example, the mask mechanism
considered as hardware details makes the job initiation times of task
$\tau_i$ possibly not equal to $kT_i$, implying that the deadlines of
the jobs may be not equal to $(k+1)T_i$ (see assumption A1'). Another
example is that non-determinism exists in our model, as discussed in
Section VI.

4. The description in section IV (A-E) is trivial, it can only be
viewed as a simple application of the rewriting logic.

\ANSWER: Yes, we agree that this is an application of rewriting
logic. In this paper, we do apply the existing theories and techniques
of rewriting logic to solve a real industrial problem, which has not
yet been investigated by this sort of techniques, achieving an
industrial contribution.

5. The model checking part is not sufficiently discussed, the authors
only list the commands but not illustrate the mechanism behind these
commands.

\ANSWER: We do not agree that we should illustrate the mechanism behind
the model checking commands, since the model checker is not part of
our contributions in the paper.

Based on the above comments, I thinks this paper is only a simple
application [26] and [27] in RMS, hence I do not recommend this paper.
